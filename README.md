# BookSwap
This is a graduation project.The goal of the project is to make it possible for people to exchange the books between them. The application has a library of books sent by people. Users can get one or more books by sending the same number of books. The books will be added after the adminâ€™s check. If books are unreadable and inappropriate as content, it will be sent back to their owners. Also, users can donate books.
